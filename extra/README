Shishi extra/README -- notes for the extra/ subdirectory.
See the end for copying conditions.

The inetutils/ sub-directory contains a copy of GNU Inetutils with a
telnet implementation with Shishi support.  Ideally I would like to
see GNU Inetutils incorporate this feature, but until or unless that
happens the work can be found in this directory.  A patch that applies
to GNU Inetutils is found in the file inetutils.diff in this
directory.

The pam_shishi/ sub-directory contains a PAM module that uses Shishi
for authenticating users.
