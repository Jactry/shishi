Shishi README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.
Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

Shishi is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, SHISHI IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE
IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.

To compile from CVS, you need perl, texinfo, GTK-DOC, autoconf 2.5+,
and automake 1.7+.  Bootstrap the build environment with:

  $ ./autogen.sh

Then run ./configure etc as usual.
