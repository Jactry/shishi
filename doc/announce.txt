Subject: Shishi 1.0.2 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
Shishi is an implementation of the Kerberos 5 network authentication
system.  Shishi can be used to authenticate users in distributed
systems.  Shishi is part of a GNU system.

* Version 1.0.2 (released 2013-04-03)

** libshishi: Fix server-realm handling.
Reported by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** libshishi: Fix salt derivation for principals with multiple components.
Before, when adding a principal such as "user/admin" using shisa it
would use the wrong salt.  Reported by Mats Erik Andersson
<gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** libshishi: Fix setting principals with multiple components in encticketpart.
Before, the shishid KDC would return the wrong client principal name
in a KDC-REP when principals such as "user/admin" were used.  That
would lead to errors when getting a ticket for such principals.
Reported by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** libshishi: Fixes to .k5login authorization.
Patch by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** shishid: The syslog facility is now LOG_AUTH instead of LOG_DAEMON.
Suggested by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** minitasn1: Removed.  You must use an external installed libtasn1.
With recent libtasn1 it is no longer trivial to build libtasn1 as
copied source code files.

** Update gnulib files and various other fixes.

Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by application
developers to add support for Kerberos 5.  Shishi contains a command
line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and manage
tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key Distribution Center (KDC),
is implemented by 'shishid', and support X.509 authenticated TLS via
GnuTLS.  Of course, a manual documenting usage aspects as well as the
programming API is included.

Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets,
pre-authentication, the AP exchange for performing client and server
authentication, and SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected
application data exchanges.  The DES, 3DES, ARCFOUR, and AES
cryptographic algorithms are supported.

Shishi aims to be internationalized, thread safe and portable.  Shishi
is written in ANSI/ISO C89, and has been ported to numerous platforms,
including most major Unix platforms and Windows, running on devices
including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.  Shishi can also be cross
compiled to Microsoft Windows using mingw32 and embedded platforms such
as the Motorola Coldfire.

Current work items include improvements on the server (KDC), integration
of initial authentication via OpenPGP using GnuTLS, set-passwd
implementation, and a LDAP backend for the Shisa library used in the KDC
for information storage.  Assistance is appreciated on any of these (or
other) items.

Improving Shishi is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Shishi useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money
or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for Shishi are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Shishi
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.
