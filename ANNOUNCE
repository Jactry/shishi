Shishi ANNOUNCE -- Overview to attract interest.

Shishi is a (still incomplete) implementation of the Kerberos 5
network authentication system.  Shishi can be used to authenticate
users in distributed systems.

Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by
application developers to add support for Kerberos 5.  Shishi contains
a command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and
manage tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key Distribution
Center, is implemented by 'shishid'.  Of course, a manual documenting
usage aspects as well as the programming API is included.

Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets, the
AP exchange for performing client and server authentication, and
SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected application data exchanges.

Shishi is internationalized; error and status messages can be
translated into the users' language; user name and passwords can be
converted into any available character set (normally including
ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and also be processed using an experimental
Stringprep profile.

Most common encryption types and checksum types are supported, such as
DES, 3DES, AES and MD4, MD5, HMAC-SHA1.

Shishi is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.

Shishi is free software licensed under the GNU General Public License.
