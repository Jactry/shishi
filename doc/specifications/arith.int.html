<h1> Chapter 5 -- integer arithmetic</h1>

<pre>

all about integer arithmetic.
-------------------------------


operations we'll get to know (and love):
    addition
    subtraction
    multiplication
    division
    logical operations (not, and, or, nand, nor, xor, xnor)
    shifting


the rules for doing the arithmetic operations vary depending
on what representation is implied.

A LITTLE BIT ON ADDING
----------------------
  an overview for unsigned integers


	carry in  a  b | sum  carry out
	---------------+----------------
	   0      0  0 |  0    0
	   0      0  1 |  1    0
	   0      1  0 |  1    0
	   0      1  1 |  0    1
	   1      0  0 |  1    0
	   1      0  1 |  0    1
	   1      1  0 |  0    1
	   1      1  1 |  1    1
                       |

       a      0011
      +b     +0001
      --     -----
     sum      0100


  its really just like we do for decimal!
    0 + 0 = 0
    1 + 0 = 1
    1 + 1 = 2  which is 10 in binary, sum is 0 and carry the 1.
    1 + 1 + 1 = 3  sum is 1, and carry a 1.




ADDITION
--------

unsigned:
  just like the simple addition given.

  examples:

      100001           00001010 (10)
     +011101          +00001110 (14)
     -------          ---------
      111110           00011000 (24)

  Ignore (throw away) carry out of the msb.

  We do unsigned addition with the assumption that we are
  working of a fixed precision value. Fixed precision means
  that the number of bits can not change.



sign magnitude:

  rules:
    - do unsigned addition on magnitudes only (do not carry into the sign bit)
    - throw away any carry out of the msb of the magnitude
    - add only integers of like sign ( + to +    or    - to -)
    - sign of result is same as sign of the addends

  examples:

    0  0101 (5)        1  1010 (-10)
  + 0  0011 (3)      + 1  0011 (-3)
  ---------          ---------
    0  1000 (8)        1  1101 (-13)


    0  01011 (11)
  + 1  01110 (-14)
  ----------------
  don't add! must do subtraction!

  Again, we do sign magnitude addition with the assumption that we are
  working of a fixed precision value. Fixed precision means
  that the number of bits can not change.




one's complement:

   by example (using the unsigned addition algorithm)


    00111 (7)         111110 (-1)            11110 (-1)
  + 00101 (5)       + 000010 (2)           + 11100 (-3)
  -----------       ------------           ------------
    01100 (12)      1 000000 (0) wrong!    1 11010 (-5) wrong!
			+  1                  +  1
		      ----------             ----------
		      000001 (1) right!      11011 (-4) right!


   So, it seems that if there is a carry out of the msb, then
   the result will be off by 1, so add 1 again to get the correct
   result.  (Implementation in HW called an "end around carry.")




two's complement:

   rules:
     - just do unsigned addition
     - throw away any carry out of the msb

   examples


    00011 (3)         101000               111111 (-1)
  + 11100 (-4)      + 010000             + 001000 (8)
  ------------      --------             --------
    11111 (-1)        111000             1 000111 (7)
                                         ^
					 this bit is thrown away

After seeing examples for all these representations, you may see
why 2's complement addition requires simpler hardware than
sign mag. or one's complement addition.



SUBTRACTION
-----------
  general rules:
    1 - 1 = 0
    0 - 0 = 0
    1 - 0 = 1
   10 - 1 = 1
    0 - 1 = borrow!




unsigned:
 
  -  it only makes sense to subtract a smaller number from a larger one

  example

     1011 (11)   must borrow
  -  0111 (7)
  ------------
     0100 (4)



sign magnitude:

  - if the signs are the same, then  do subtraction
  - if signs are different, then change the problem to addition
  - Compare magnitudes, then subtract smaller from larger.
    If the order is switched, then switch the sign too.

  - when the integers are of the opposite sign, then do
	a - b    becomes   a + (-b)
	a + b    becomes   a - (-b)


     examples

   0 00111 (7)             1 11000 (-24)
 - 0 11000 (24)          - 1 00010 (-2)
 --------------          --------------
                           1 10110 (-22)
do 0 11000 (24)
 - 0 00111 (7)
 --------------
   1 10001 (-17)
   (switch sign since the order of the subtraction was reversed)




one's complement:

     figure it out on your own




two's complement:

  - change the problem to addition!

       a - b  becomes   a + (-b)

  - so, get the additive inverse of b, and do addition.

    examples

   10110 (-10)
 - 00011 (3)    -->       00011
 ------------              
			  11100 (after taking the 1's complement)
			+     1
			-------
			  11101 (-3)
 so do

     10110 (-10)
   + 11101 (-3)
   ------------
     10011  (-13)
  (throw away carry out)


OVERFLOW
---------

OVERFLOW DETECTION IN ADDITION

  unsigned -- when there is a carry out of the msb

	   1000 (8)
	  +1001 (9)
	  -----
	 1 0001 (1)

  sign magnitude -- when there is a carry out of the msb of the magnitude

	 1 1000 (-8)
       + 1 1001 (-9)
	  -----
	 1 0001 (-1)  (carry out of msb of magnitude)

  2's complement -- when the signs of the addends are the same, and the
		    sign of the result is different

	  0011 (3)
	+ 0110 (6)
	----------
	  1001 (-7)   (note that a correct answer would be 9, but
		       9 cannot be represented in 4-bit 2's complement)

  a detail -- you will never get overflow when adding 2 numbers of
	      opposite signs


OVERFLOW DETECTION IN SUBTRACTION

   unsigned -- never
   sign magnitude -- never happen when doing subtraction
   2's complement -- We never do subtraction. If the addition operation
      causes overflow, then overflow occurs. 




MULTIPLICATION of integers
     
     0 x 0 = 0
     0 x 1 = 0
     1 x 0 = 0
     1 x 1 = 1

     -- longhand, it looks just like decimal

     -- the result can require 2x as many bits as the larger operand

     -- in 2's complement, to always get the right answer without
	thinking about the problem, sign extend both integers to
	twice as many bits (as the larger).  Then take the correct number
	of result bits from the least significant portion of the result.
	Note that the HW that implements multiplication does not
	use this algorithm.

 
    2's complement example:
	  

	     1111 1111        -1
	   x 1111 1001     x  -7

   multiplicand
 x   multiplier
 ----------------
    product


If we do NOT sign extend the operands (multiplier and multiplicand),
before doing the multiplication, then the wrong answer sometimes
results.  To make this work, sign-extend the partial products
to the correct number of bits.

To ease our work, classify which do work, and which don't.

DIVISION of integers
     unsigned only in this class!
     (Don't worry, you'll do lots of division in CS/ECE 552!)

	        quotient
             ----------------
     divisor | dividend
     

     written as fractions:      dividend
                                --------

LOGICAL OPERATIONS
-------------------
   They are done bitwise.

   Bitwise means corresponding bits of the operands are operated
   on, with the single bit result going into the corresponding
   bit of the result.

   bit 0 of X goes with bit 0 of Y, and the result goes in bit 0.

                     X =  0011
		     Y =  1010

       X  AND  Y is       0010
       X   OR  Y is       1011
       X  NOR  Y is       0100
       X  XOR  Y is       1001
		etc.


SHIFT OPERATIONS
----------------
  A way of moving bits around within a word.
  A shift by n places is the same as n shifts by 1 place.

  3 types:     logical, arithmetic and rotate
	       (each type can go either left or right)

  logical left - move bits to the left, same order
	       - throw away the bit that pops off the msb
	       - introduce a 0 into the lsb


	       00110101

	       01101010 (logically left shifted by 1 bit)

	   
  logical right - move bits to the right, same order
	       - throw away the bit that pops off the lsb
	       - introduce a 0 into the msb

	       00110101

	       00011010  (logically right shifted by 1 bit)


  arithmetic left - move bits to the left, same order
	       - throw away the bit that pops off the msb
	       - introduce a 0 into the lsb
	       - SAME AS LOGICAL LEFT SHIFT!



  arithmetic right - move bits to the right, same order
	       - throw away the bit that pops off the lsb
	       - reproduce the original msb into the new msb 
	       - another way of thinking about it:  shift the
		 bits, and then do sign extension

	       00110101 ->  00011010 (arithmetically right shifted by 1 bit)

	       1100 -> 1110   (arithmetically right shifted by 1 bit)



  rotate left - move bits to the left, same order
	      - put the bit that pops off the msb into the lsb,
		so no bits are thrown away or lost.

	       00110101 -> 01101010 (rotated left by 1 place)       
	       1100 -> 1001 (rotated left by 1 place)


  rotate right - move bits to the right, same order
	      - put the bit that pops off the lsb into the msb,
		so no bits are thrown away or lost.

	       00110101 -> 10011010 (rotated right by 1 place)        
	       1100 ->  0110 (rotated right by 1 place)




SAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOGICAL AND SHIFT OPERATIONS

   SAL has instructions that do bitwise logical operations and
   shifting operations (ON .word OPERANDS!).


	not   x, y         x <-  NOT (y)
	and   x, y, z      x <-  (y) AND (z)
	or    x, y, z      x <-  (y) OR (z)
	nor   x, y, z      x <-  (y) NOR (z)

	sra   x, y, value     x <- (y), arithmetically right shifted by
					value bits
	rol   x, y, value     x <- (y), rotated left by value bits
	ror   x, y, value     x <- (y), rotated right by value bits




A common student question occurs as a result of learning of
the shift and logical operations:  what are they used for?

Here are some examples as a partial answer to the question.


  Example:
      A certain program has a bunch of boolean values that
      it will need to maintain.

      Place all these (bit-sized) variables into one (word-sized)
      integer variable:

      Bit number:     31     30 . . . .  2    1    0
      Contents       var31  var30       var2 var1 var0

      So, we've got up to 32 variables placed into one integer.
      Let this integer be called var.

      What would we want to do to these boolean variables?
      Answer:  individually set (make a 1) or clear (make a 0)
      a variable.


      SAL code to set var5:

              or  var, var, 0x00000020
      Whatever was in all bits other than bit 5 remain the same,
      and bit 5 (called var5 for this example, but not in code)
      gets the value 1.



      SAL code to clear var12 and var3:

              and  var, var, 0xffffeff7
      Whatever was in all bits other than bits 12 and 3 remain the same,
      and bits 12 and 3 get the value 0.

      The value 0xffffeff7 (or 0x00000020 in the previous example)
      is called a MASK.  It specifies the settings of bits.
      Here is the mapping of some of the bits to show how the
      mask was created.

      bit #      15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
      contents    1  1  1  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  1  1  1



  A completely different example:
      Suppose that we want to do operations on strings.
      (A string is a bunch of characters that happen to reside
      next to each other in memory.)

      What operations might be appropriate?
         Insert characters?  Concatenate strings?  Switch order
	 of characters?  Change lower case to upper case?

      What do strings look like?
         The ASCII characters are placed into memory one following
	 another.  Yet, to operate on parts of strings, we might
	 want to work on integer-sized chunks. . .
	 An operand the size of an integer is most often called
	 a WORD on a computer.


	 Part of a string in a 32-bit word:
	   
           -------------------------
	   | 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' |
           -------------------------

      Call this variable x.  Write a SAL code fragment that
      reverses the middle two characters, without changing
      the rest.


           and   temp1, x, 0x00ff0000   # extract out the 'B' byte
           and   temp2, x, 0x0000ff00   # extract out the 'C' byte
	   and   x, x, 0xff0000ff       # clear middle 2 bytes
	   srl   temp1, temp1, 8        # move the 'B' 1 byte to right
	   sll   temp2, temp2, 8        # move the 'C' 1 byte to left
	   or    x, x, temp1            # merge moved 'B' back in
	   or    x, x, temp2            # merge moved 'C' back in
