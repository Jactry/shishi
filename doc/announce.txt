Subject: Shishi 1.0.0
<#part sign=pgpmime>
Shishi is an implementation of the Kerberos 5 network authentication
system.  Shishi can be used to authenticate users in distributed
systems.  Shishi is part of a GNU system.

* Version 1.0.0 (released 2010-05-20)

** doc: Added PDF version of API reference manual.
See doc/reference/shishi.pdf.

** doc: Added Cyclomatic Code Complexity charts.
See doc/cyclo/.

** build: Fix building with --disable-starttls.
Reported by Johan van Selst <johans@stack.nl> in

** minitasn1: Internal copy upgraded to GNU Libtasn1 v2.6.

** Doc fixes.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by
application developers to add support for Kerberos 5.  Shishi contains
a command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and
manage tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key Distribution Center
(KDC), is implemented by 'shishid', and support X.509 authenticated
TLS via GnuTLS.  Of course, a manual documenting usage aspects as well
as the programming API is included.

Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets,
pre-authentication, the AP exchange for performing client and server
authentication, and SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected
application data exchanges.  The DES, 3DES, ARCFOUR, and AES
cryptographic algorithms are supported.

Shishi aims to be internationalized, thread safe and portable.  Shishi
is written in ANSI/ISO C89, and has been ported to numerous platforms,
including most major Unix platforms and Windows, running on devices
including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.  Shishi can also be
cross compiled to Microsoft Windows using mingw32 and embedded
platforms such as the Motorola Coldfire.

Current work items include improvements on the server (KDC),
integration of initial authentication via OpenPGP using GnuTLS,
set-passwd implementation, and a LDAP backend for the Shisa library
used in the KDC for information storage.  Assistance is appreciated on
any of these (or other) items.

Improving Shishi is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Shishi useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate
money or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for Shishi are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Shishi
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.
