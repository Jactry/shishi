See the end for copying conditions.

* Version 0.0.1 (unreleased)

** InetUtils copy removed (we send patches upstream instead).

** Libidn copy removed (it is optional but recommended, used when present).

** Gettext not included.
Due to some conflicts between libtool and gettext, if you want i18n on
platforms that does not already have a useful gettext implementation,
you can install GNU gettext before building this package.  If you
don't care about i18n, this package should work fine (except for i18n,
of course).

** Libtasn1 and Libgcrypt updated (libpgp-error added in errcrypto/).

** Argp and other compatibility files replaced by gl/ directory.

** Cleanups, bug fixes and various improvements.

* Version 0.0.0 (released 2003-06-02)

** Initial release
