Shishi ANNOUNCE -- Overview to attract interest.
See the end for copying conditions.

Shishi is an (still incomplete) implementation of the RFC 1510 and RFC
1510bis network authentication system, also known as Kerberos.  RFC
1510 can be used to authenticate users in distributed systems.

Shishi contains a library ('libgsasl') that can be used by application
developers to add support for RFC 1510.  Shishi contains a command
line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to interface with the
library, to acquire and manage tickets (and more).  Included are also
a TELNET client and server (based on GNU InetUtils) for remote network
login, and a PAM module for host security.  Of course, a manual
documenting user aspects as well as the programming API is included.

Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets, and
the AP exchange for performing client and server authentication.
Shishi is internationalized; error and status messages can be
translated into the users' language; username and passwords can be
converted into any available character set (normally including
ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and be processed using an experimental
Stringprep profile.  The des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-md5, des3-cbc-sha1-kd,
aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96, and aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 encryption types,
and the rsa-md4-des, rsa-md5-des, hmac-sha1-des3-kd,
hmac-sha1-96-aes128, hmac-sha1-96-aes256 checksum types are supported.

Shishi is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms, including most major Unix platforms and Windows.

Shishi is free software licensed under the GNU Public License.
