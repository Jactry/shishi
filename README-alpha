Shishi is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, SHISHI IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE
IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!
