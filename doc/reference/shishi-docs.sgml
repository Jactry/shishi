    <title>Shishi API Reference Manual</title>

    <para>
Shishi is a (still incomplete) implementation of the RFC 1510 and RFC
1510bis network authentication system.  RFC 1510 can be used to
authenticate users in distributed systems.
    </para>
    <para>
Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by
application developers to add support for RFC 1510.  Shishi contains a
command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to interface
with the library, to acquire and manage tickets (and more).  Included
are also a TELNET client and server (based on GNU InetUtils) for
remote network login, and a PAM module for host security.  Of course,
a manual documenting user aspects as well as the programming API is
included.
    </para>
    <para>
Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets, and
the AP exchange for performing client and server authentication.
Shishi is internationalized; error and status messages can be
translated into the users' language; username and passwords can be
converted into any available character set (normally including
ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and be processed using an experimental
Stringprep profile.  The des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-md5, des3-cbc-sha1-kd,
aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96, and aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 encryption types,
and the rsa-md4-des, rsa-md5-des, hmac-sha1-des3-kd,
hmac-sha1-96-aes128, hmac-sha1-96-aes256 checksum types are supported.
