Shishi ANNOUNCE -- Overview to attract interest.

See the end for copying conditions.

Shishi is a (still incomplete) implementation of the RFC 1510(bis)
network authentication system.  Shishi can be used to authenticate
users in distributed systems.

Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by
application developers to add support for RFC 1510.  Shishi contains a
command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and
manage tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key Distribution
Center, is implemented by 'shishid'.  Of course, a manual documenting
usage aspects as well as the programming API is included.

Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets, the
AP exchange for performing client and server authentication, and SAFE
for integrity protected application data exchanges.  Shishi is
internationalized; error and status messages can be translated into
the users' language; user name and passwords can be converted into any
available character set (normally including ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and
also be processed using an experimental Stringprep profile.  The
des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-md5, des3-cbc-sha1-kd, aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96,
and aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 encryption types, and the rsa-md4-des,
rsa-md5-des, hmac-sha1-des3-kd, hmac-sha1-96-aes128,
hmac-sha1-96-aes256 checksum types are supported.

Shishi is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.
