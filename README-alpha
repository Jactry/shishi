Shishi README-alpha -- Important introductory notes for alpha releases.
Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

Shishi is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.  Let me repeat that, SHISHI IS MOST LIKELY INSECURE. DO NOT USE
IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.

To compile from CVS, you need perl, texinfo, GTK-DOC, autoconf 2.5+,
automake 1.7+, help2man, asn1Parser from Libtasn1 CVS (or copy
lib/kerberos5.c from Shishi releases, it rarely changes), and
gengetopt 2.12rc.  Bootstrap the build environment with:

  $ ./autogen.sh

Then run ./configure etc as usual.

A note to binary package builders: please build using --disable-shared
because during the development phase, only the so revision will be
bumped on releases.  If you build shared libraries, other packages
that link to them may stop working when a new release of the library
is installed.  The reason for this is simply that the package is not
mature enough to warrant proper shared object versioning.
