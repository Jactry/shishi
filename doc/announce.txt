Subject: Shishi 0.0.43 (release candidate for 1.0.0)

<#part sign=pgpmime>

Shishi is an implementation of the Kerberos 5 network authentication
system.  Shishi can be used to authenticate users in distributed
systems.  Shishi is part of a GNU system.

Note that we plan to release version 1.0.0 soon and this release
should be regarded as a release candidate.  Shishi has been relatively
stable for a long period of time, so it deserves a non-alpha release.

* Version 0.0.43 (released 2010-03-30)

** libshishi, shishid: Make IPv6 support work.

** shishid: Add --no-tls parameter to disable TLS support.

** libshishi, shishid: STARTTLS extension negotiation now follows RFC 5021.

** doc: Fix spelling typos noticed by lintian.

** Update gnulib files.
Including moving the 'stat' module from db/ to gl/ so that libshishi
builds properly.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by application
developers to add support for Kerberos 5.  Shishi contains a command
line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and manage
tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key Distribution Center (KDC),
is implemented by 'shishid', and support X.509 authenticated TLS via
GnuTLS.  Of course, a manual documenting usage aspects as well as the
programming API is included.

Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets,
pre-authentication, the AP exchange for performing client and server
authentication, and SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected
application data exchanges.  The DES, 3DES, ARCFOUR, and AES
cryptographic algorithms are supported.

Shishi aims to be internationalized, thread safe and portable.  Shishi
is written in ANSI/ISO C89, and has been ported to numerous platforms,
including most major Unix platforms and Windows, running on devices
including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.  Shishi can also be cross
compiled to Microsoft Windows using mingw32 and embedded platforms such
as the Motorola Coldfire.

Current work items include improvements on the server (KDC), integration
of initial authentication via OpenPGP using GnuTLS, set-passwd
implementation, and a LDAP backend for the Shisa library used in the KDC
for information storage.  Assistance is appreciated on any of these (or
other) items.

Improving Shishi is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Shishi useful and wish to contribute back.  You
can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate money
or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for Shishi are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Shishi
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.
