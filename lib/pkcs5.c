 * 5.2 PBKDF2
 *
 *  PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function (see Appendix B.1 for an
 *  example) to derive keys. The length of the derived key is essentially
 *  unbounded. (However, the maximum effective search space for the
 *  derived key may be limited by the structure of the underlying
 *  pseudorandom function. See Appendix B.1 for further discussion.)
 *  PBKDF2 is recommended for new applications.
 *
 *  PBKDF2 (P, S, c, dkLen)
 *
 *  Options:        PRF        underlying pseudorandom function (hLen
 *                             denotes the length in octets of the
 *                             pseudorandom function output)
 *
 *  Input:          P          password, an octet string
 *                  S          salt, an octet string
 *                  c          iteration count, a positive integer
 *                  dkLen      intended length in octets of the derived
 *                             key, a positive integer, at most
 *                             (2^32 - 1) * hLen
 *
 *  Output:         DK         derived key, a dkLen-octet string

   *                  U_c = PRF (P, U_{c-1}) .
   *
   *        Here, INT (i) is a four-octet encoding of the integer i, most
   *        significant octet first.
   *
   *     4. Concatenate the blocks and extract the first dkLen octets to
   *        produce a derived key DK:

   *                  DK = T_1 || T_2 ||  ...  || T_l<0..r-1>
   *
   *     5. Output the derived key DK.
   *
   *  Note. The construction of the function F follows a "belt-and-
   *  suspenders" approach. The iterates U_i are computed recursively to
   *  remove a degree of parallelism from an opponent; they are exclusive-
   *  ored together to reduce concerns about the recursion degenerating
   *  into a small set of values.
