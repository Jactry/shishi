The inetutils/ sub-directory contains a stripped down GNU Inetutils
containing a telnet implementation with Shishi support.  Ideally I
would like to see GNU Inetutils incorporate this feature, but until or
unless that happens the work can be found in this directory.

A patch that applies to GNU Inetutils is found in inetutils.diff in
this directory.
