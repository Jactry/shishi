This directory holds an implementation of RFC 1510 (Kerberos 5).

Shishi is unstable and in its early steps of development.  You should
expect it to not work as well as having security problems.  The API
will likely change.

Things left to do below.  If you like to start working on anything,
please let me know so work duplication can be avoided.

  * Cross-realm operation.
  + PKINIT?
  + Documentation.
  + I18n.
  - Port more applications to use shishi.
  - Port to Cyclone?
  - Fix the BUFSIZ stuff.
  - Replace ASN1_TYPE with Shishi_asn1 and isolate the libtasn1 calls
    into lib/asn1.c to make it easy to replace the ASN1 library.

Shishi will not contain a GSSAPI library, but a separate project to
create a GSSAPI library is being considered and would contain a Shishi
backend.
