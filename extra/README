Shishi extra/README -- Notes for the extra/ subdirectory.
Copyright (C) 2002, 2003 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

The inetutils/ sub-directory contains a copy of GNU Inetutils with a
telnet implementation with Shishi support.  Ideally I would like to
see GNU Inetutils incorporate this feature, but until or unless that
happens the work can be found in this directory.  A patch that applies
to GNU Inetutils is found in the file inetutils.diff in this
directory.  (This only exists in CVS, and is not linked into the
Shishi build environment.)

The pam_shishi/ sub-directory contains a PAM module that uses Shishi
for authenticating users.
