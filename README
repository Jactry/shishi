Shishi README -- important introductory notes
See the end for copying conditions.

This directory holds an implementation of RFC 1510 (aka Kerberos 5).

Shishi is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You should
expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely change.
This is the development release.  A proper release will be made in due
time.

Installation instructions are found in the INSTALL file in this
directory.  Further instructions are found in doc/shishi.info.
