# Unless you you specify which configuration file to use (with the
# commandline option "--configuration-file filename"), Shishi uses the
# file $HOME/.shishi/config by default.  Note that the system
# configuration file is read before this file.  Settings specified
# here overrides those specified in the system configuration file.
#
# An option file can contain all long options which are
# available in Shishi. If the first non white space character of
# a line is a '#', this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also
# ignored.

# See the manual for a list of options.

# Specify the default realm, by default the hostname of the host is used.
#default-realm JOSEFSSON.ORG

# Specify the default principal, by default the login username is used.
#default-principal jas

# Specify which encryption types client asks server to respond in
# during AS/TGS exchanges. List valid encryption types, in preference
# order.  Supported algorithms include des3-hmac-sha1-kd, des-cbc-md5,
# des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-crc and null.  This also indicates which
# encryption types are accepted by the client when receiving the response.
# Note that the preference order is not cryptographically protected,
# so a man in the middle can modify the order without being detected.
# Thus, only specify encryption types you trust completely here.  The
# default only includes aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96, as suggested by
# RFC1510bis.

# Also print ASN.1 dump of packets.

# And other rarely interesting information.
